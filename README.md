## End-to-end machine learning project with CI/CD pipelines: https://github.com/alrSasani/End_to_End_Flushot
In this project I have developed a package that does the training, and optimizing different models provided to the package and chooses the best model
while tracking the models' performances using mlflow, the package moves the best model to the production stage where it uses it for serving. The CI/CD pipelines are developed in Amazone web service using codepipeline service and elastic beanstalk. The Django is used to create interactive UI.

ETL pipeline for Airbnb data from Kaggle: https://github.com/alrSasani/Kaggle_airbnb_ETL
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for Airbnb data using Apache Airflow, Kaggle API, Pandas, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The project's primary goal is to extract data from Kaggle, transform it using Python and Pandas, and then load it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. This ETL pipeline is designed to run in a Dockerized environment, ensuring a consistent and reproducible setup.

Richter prediction: https://github.com/alrSasani/Richter_Prediction
In this work, I have analyzed the data using postgresql. Then I used different classification models to predict a multi-class classification where we predict the destruction grade that an earthquake will have on a building based on the features given.

Exploratory data analysis of stack overflow survey: https://github.com/alrSasani/Stack_Overflow_DS
The project aims to explore trends and insights within the global developer community, covering aspects such as remote work preferences, compensation, technology usage, educational backgrounds, and the impact of emerging technologies.
